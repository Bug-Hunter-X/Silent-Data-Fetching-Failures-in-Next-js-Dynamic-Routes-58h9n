# Silent Data Fetching Failures in Next.js Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Next.js related to data fetching within `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` in dynamic routes. The issue involves scenarios where the data fetching process fails, but Next.js doesn't provide clear error messages, leading to blank pages or unexpected behavior.

## Problem
When fetching data for a dynamic route (e.g., `/posts/[slug]`), if the API call or data source fails for a specific `slug`, Next.js might not correctly handle the error.  This usually results in a silent failureâ€”no error messages are shown to the user or the developer.  Debugging can be challenging because the usual error handling mechanisms don't seem to catch the issue.

## Solution
The solution involves robust error handling within `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`. This includes explicitly checking for API errors, handling HTTP status codes, and providing fallback mechanisms to display user-friendly error messages when data is unavailable.
