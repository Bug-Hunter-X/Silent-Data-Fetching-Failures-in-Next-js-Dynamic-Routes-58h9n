In Next.js, an uncommon error arises when using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` within a dynamic route, specifically when handling edge cases in data fetching. For instance, if an API request within `getStaticProps` fails to return data for a specific dynamic route segment, Next.js might not gracefully handle the error, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.  The error is not always explicitly stated; instead, you might see a blank page or a generic Next.js error.
